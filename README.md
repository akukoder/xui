# XUI - Laravel Blade Component

Did your developers can't keep up with the UI changes? Or your area using Bootstrap and now your management decided to switch to Tailwind CSS?

Yes, I know, it's painful to adapt to new changes. You have to rewrite your Blade files. 

With the new [Blade Component](https://laravel.com/docs/blade#components), I really hope it can helps reduce the amount of codes to re-write.

```composer require akukoder/xui```
